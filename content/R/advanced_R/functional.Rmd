##Introduction
A **functional** is a function that takes a function as an input and returns a vector as output. Here’s a simple functional: it calls the function provided as input with 1000 random uniform numbers.

```{r}
randomise <- function(f) f(runif(1e3))
randomise(mean)
randomise(mean)
randomise(sum)

```

This chapter will focus on functionals provided by the purrr package

```{r,results='hide'}
library(purrr)
```

```{r}
triple <- function(x) x * 3
map(1:3, triple)
```
如下圖:

map function 回傳 list 

下面map__*則回傳特定的atomic vector


These examples rely on two facts: mtcars is a data frame, and data frames are lists containing vectors of the same length. This is more obvious if we draw a data frame with the same orientation as vector:
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/12f6af8404d9723dff9cc665028a35f07759299d/d0d9a/diagrams/functionals/map-list.png" width="335" style="display: block; margin: auto;">
```{r}
# map_chr() always returns a character vector
map_chr(mtcars, typeof)

# map_lgl() always returns a logical vector
map_lgl(mtcars, is.double)

# map_int() always returns a integer vector
n_unique <- function(x) length(unique(x))
map_int(mtcars, n_unique)

# map_dbl() always returns a double vector
map_dbl(mtcars, mean)
```
##Anonymous functions and shortcuts
```{r}
map_dbl(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))
```
簡化寫法:
```{r}
map_dbl(mtcars, ~ length(unique(.x)))
```
以下寫法通常用來產生data:
```{r}
x <- map(1:3, ~runif(2))
str(x)
```
The map functions for extracting elements from a vector ,
You can use a character vector to select elements by name, an integer vector to select by position, or a list to select by both name and position.These are very useful for working with deeply nested lists, which often arise when working with JSON.
```{r}
x <- list(
  list(-1, x = 1, y = c(2), z = "a"),
  list(-2, x = 4, y = c(5, 6), z = "b"),
  list(-3, x = 8, y = c(9, 10, 11))
)

# Select by name
map_dbl(x, "x")
#> [1] 1 4 8

# Or by position
map_dbl(x, 1)
#> [1] -1 -2 -3

# Or by both
map_dbl(x, list("y", 1))
#> [1] 2 5 9

# You'll get an error if a component doesn't exist:
#map_chr(x, "z")
#> Error: Result 3 must be a single string, not NULL of length 0

# Unless you supply a .default value
map_chr(x, "z", .default = NA)

```
## Passing arguments with `...`
It’s often convenient to pass along additional arguments to the function that you’re calling. For example, you might want to pass na.rm = TRUE along to mean(). One way to do that is with an anonymous function:
```{r}
Y <- list(1:5, c(1:10, NA))
map_dbl(Y, ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE))
```
But because the map functions pass `...` along, there’s a simpler form available:
```{r}
map_dbl(x, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```
map(直觀圖:

Note there’s a subtle difference between placing extra arguments inside an anonymous function compared with passing them to map(). Putting them in an anonymous function means that they will be evaluated every time f() is executed, not just once when you call map(). This is easiest to see if we make the additional argument random:
```{r}
plus <- function(x, y) x + y

x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
map_dbl(x, plus, runif(1))# runif(1) 只使用一次的結果

map_dbl(x, ~ plus(.x, runif(1))) #x長度4,所以使用4次runif(1)
```

##Varying another argument
 How do you get the result in this picture?

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6d0b927ba5266f886cc721ae090afcc5e872a748/f8636/diagrams/functionals/map-arg-flipped.png" width="359" style="display: block; margin: auto;">


It turns out that there’s no way to do it directly, but there are two tricks you can use instead. To illustrate them, imagine I have a vector that contains a few unusual values, and I want to explore the effect of different amounts of trimming when computing the mean. In this case, the first argument to `mean()` will be constant, and I want to vary the second argument, `trim`.
```{r}
trims <- c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5)
x <- rcauchy(1000)
```
+  The simplest technique is to use an anonymous function to rearrange the argument order:

```{r}
map_dbl(trims, ~ mean(x, trim = .x))
#or
map_dbl(trims, function(trim) mean(x, trim = trim))
```

## Purrr style
Before we go on to explore more map variants, let’s take a quick look at how you tend to use multiple purrr functions to solve a moderately realistic problem: fitting a model to each subgroup and extracting a coefficient of the model. For this toy example, I’m going to break the `mtcars` data set down into groups defined by the number of cylinders, using the base `split` function:
```{r}
by_cyl <- split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)

```
This creates a list of three data frames: the cars with 4, 6, and 8 cylinders respectively.

Now imagine we want to fit a linear model, then extract the second coefficient (i.e. the slope). The following code shows how you might do that with purrr:

```{r}
by_cyl %>% 
  map(function(x) lm(mpg ~ wt, data = x)) %>% #(or map(~ lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .x)))
  map(coef) %>% 
  map_dbl(2)
```
同以下寫法:
```{r}
by_cyl %>% 
  lapply(function(data) lm(mpg ~ wt, data = data)) %>% 
  lapply(coef) %>% 
  vapply(function(x) x[[2]], double(1))
```

```{r}
models <- lapply(by_cyl, function(data) lm(mpg ~ wt, data = data))
vapply(models, function(x) coef(x)[[2]], double(1))
```

```{r}
intercepts <- double(length(by_cyl))
for (i in seq_along(by_cyl)) {
  model <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = by_cyl[[i]])
  intercepts[[i]] <- coef(model)[[2]]
}
intercepts
```


## Map variants
 five new ideas:

1. Output same type as input with modify()


2. Iterate over two inputs with map2().


3. Iterate with an index using imap()


4. Return nothing with walk().


5. Iterate over any number of inputs with pmap().

The map family of functions has orthogonal input and outputs, meaning that we can organise all the family into a matrix, with inputs in the rows and outputs in the columns. Once you’ve mastered the idea in a row, you can combine it with any column; once you’ve mastered the idea in a column, you can combine it with any row. That relationship is summarised in the following table:

<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>List</th>
<th>Atomic</th>
<th>Same type</th>
<th>Nothing</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>One argument</td>
<td><code>map()</code></td>
<td><code>map_lgl()</code>, …</td>
<td><code>modify()</code></td>
<td><code>walk()</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">

<td><code>map2()</code></td>
<td><code>map2_lgl()</code>, …</td>
<td><code>modify2()</code></td>
<td><code>walk2()</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">

<td><code>imap()</code></td>
<td><code>imap_lgl()</code>, …</td>

<td><code>iwalk()</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>N arguments</td>
<td><code>pmap()</code></td>
<td><code>pmap_lgl()</code>, …</td>
<td>—</td>
<td><code>pwalk()</code></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

###1. modify()

Imagine you wanted to double every column in a data frame. You might first try using `map()`, but `map()` always returns a list:
```{r}
df <- data.frame(
  x = 1:3,
  y = 6:4
)

map(df, function(x) x * 2)

```
If you want to keep the output as a data frame, you can use modify(), which always returns the same type of output as the input:
```{r}
modify(df, function(x) x * 2)
```
`modify()` doesn’t modify in place, it returns a modified copy, so if you wanted to permanently modify df, you’d need to assign it:
```{r}
df <- modify(df, ~ .x * 2)
```

###2. Two inputs: map2() and friends

*`map()` is vectorised over a single argument, `.x.` This means it only varies `.x` when calling `.f`, and all other arguments are passed along unchanged *, thus making it poorly suited for some problems. For example, how would you find a weighted mean when you have a list of observations and a list of weights? Imagine we have the following data:

```{r}
xs <- map(1:8, ~ runif(10))
xs[[1]][[1]] <- NA
ws <- map(1:8, ~ rpois(10, 5) + 1)
```
You can use map_dbl() to compute the unweighted means:
```{r}
map_dbl(xs, mean)
```
But passing ws as an additional argument doesn’t work because arguments after `.f`are not transformed:
```{r,error=TRUE}
map_dbl(xs, weighted.mean, w = ws)
```
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a468c847ea8aca9a6131492e1e7431f418259eaf/ce4e0/diagrams/functionals/map-arg-recycle.png" width="345" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

We need a new tool: a `map2()`, which is vectorised over two arguments. This means both `.x` and `.y` are varied in each call to `.f`:
```{r}
map2_dbl(xs, ws, weighted.mean)
```
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/f5cddf51ec9c243a7c13732b0ce46b0868bf8a31/501a8/diagrams/functionals/map2.png" width="368" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

The arguments to `map2()` are slightly different to the arguments to `map()` as two vectors come before the function, rather than one. Additional arguments still go afterwards:
```{r}
map2_dbl(xs, ws, weighted.mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7a545699ff7069a98329fcfbe6e42b734507eb16/211a5/diagrams/functionals/map2-arg.png" width="453" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

One of the big differences between map2() and the simple function above is that map2() recycles its inputs to make sure that they’re the same length:

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/55032525ec77409e381dcd200a47e1787e65b964/dcaef/diagrams/functionals/map2-recycle.png" width="368" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

###3. No outputs: walk() and friends

Most functions are called for the value that they return, so it makes sense to capture and store the value with a map() function. But some functions are called primarily for their side-effects (e.g. cat(), write.csv(), or ggsave()) and it doesn’t make sense to capture their results. Take this simple example that displays a welcome message using cat(). cat() returns NULL, so while map() works (in the sense that it generates the desired welcomes), it also returns list(NULL, NULL).
```{r}
welcome <- function(x) {
  cat("Welcome ", x, "!\n", sep = "")
}
names <- c("Hadley", "Jenny")

# As well as generate the welcomes, it also shows 
# the return value of cat()
map(names, welcome)
```
purrr provides the walk family of functions that ignore the return values of the .f and instead return .x invisibly
```{r}
walk(names, welcome)
```
One of the most useful walk() variants is walk2() because a very common side-effect is saving something to disk, and when saving something to disk you always have a pair of values: the object and the path that you want to save it to.
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/19d5f7d265107c81dded3e98319d48ec01821308/b8621/diagrams/functionals/walk2.png" width="316" style="display: block; margin: auto;">


<p>For example, imagine you have a list of data frames (which I’ve created here using <code>split()</code>), and you’d like to save each one to a separate CSV file. That’s easy with <code>walk2()</code>:</p>

```{r}
temp <- tempfile()
dir.create(temp)

cyls <- split(mtcars, mtcars$cyl)
paths <- file.path(temp, paste0("cyl-", names(cyls), ".csv"))
walk2(cyls, paths, write.csv)

dir(temp)
```

<p>Here the <code>walk2()</code> is equivalent to <code>write.csv(cyls[[1]], paths[[1]])</code>, <code>write.csv(cyls[[2]], paths[[2]])</code>, <code>write.csv(cyls[[3]], paths[[3]])</code>.</p>


### 4.  Iterating over values and indices imap
<p>There are three basic ways to loop over a vector with a for loop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loop over the elements: <code>for (x in xs)</code></li>
<li>Loop over the numeric indices: <code>for (i in seq_along(xs))</code></li>
<li>Loop over the names: <code>for (nm in names(xs))</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The first form is analogous to the <code>map()</code> family. The second and third forms are equivalent to the <code>imap()</code> family which allows you to iterate over the values and the indices of a vector in parallel.</p>
<p><code>imap()</code> is like <code>map2()</code> in the sense that your <code>.f</code> gets called with two arguments, but here both are derived from the vector. <code>imap(x, f)</code> is equivalent to <code>map2(x, names(x), f)</code> if x has names, and <code>map2(x, seq_along(x), f)</code> if it does not.</p>
<p><code>imap()</code> is often useful for constructing labels:</p>
```{r}
imap_chr(iris, ~ paste0("The first value of ", .y, " is ", .x[[1]]))
```
If the vector is unnamed, the second argument will be the index:
```{r}
x <- map(1:6, ~ sample(1000, 10))
imap_chr(x, ~ paste0("The highest value of ", .y, " is ", max(.x)))
```
<p><code>imap()</code> is a useful helper if you want to work with the values in a vector along with their positions.</p>

###5. Any number of inputs: pmap() and friends

<p>Since we have <code>map()</code> and <code>map2()</code>, you might expect <code>map3()</code>, <code>map4()</code>, <code>map5()</code>, … But where would you stop? Instead of generalising <code>map2()</code> to an arbitrary number of arguments, purrr takes a slightly different tack with <code>pmap()</code>: you supply it a single list, which contains any number of arguments. In most cases, that will be a list of equal-length vectors, i.e.&nbsp;something very similar to a data frame. In diagrams, I’ll emphasise that relationship by drawing the input similar to a data frame.</p>

<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e426c5755e2e65bdcc073d387775db79791f32fd/92902/diagrams/functionals/pmap.png" width="354" style="display: block; margin: auto;">

As before, the varying arguments come before .f (although now they must be wrapped in a list), and the constant arguments come afterwards.
```{r}
pmap_dbl(list(xs, ws), weighted.mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```

A big difference between pmap() and the other map functions is that pmap() gives you much finer control over argument matching because you can name the components of the list. Returning to our example from Section 9.2.5, where we wanted to vary the trim argument to x, we could instead use pmap():

```{r}
trims <- c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5)
x <- rcauchy(1000)

pmap_dbl(list(trim = trims), mean, x = x)
```

I think it’s good practice to name the components of the list to make it very clear how the function will be called.

It’s often convenient to call pmap() with a data frame. A handy way to create that data frame is with tibble::tribble(), which allows you to describe a data frame row-by-row

```{r}
params <- tibble::tribble(
  ~ n, ~ min, ~ max,
   1L,     0,     1,
   2L,    10,   100,
   3L,   100,  1000
)

pmap(params, runif)
```
<img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e698354d802ce16f83546db63c45a19b8d51f45e/43de7/diagrams/functionals/pmap-3.png" width="449" style="display: block; margin: auto;">


Here, the column names are critical: I’ve carefully chosen to match them to the arguments to runif(), so the pmap(params, runif) is equivalent to runif(n = 1L, min = 0, max = 1), runif(n = 2, min = 10, max = 100), runif(n = 3L, min = 100, max = 1000). (If you have a data frame in hand, and the names don’t match, use dplyr::rename() or similar.)
